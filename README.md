# PhdAnalysis
This directory is created to store all useful scripts to reproduce my ML work.

To run the following scripts IceTray needs to be installed on your machine
For now (as of December 2023), the current working branch of IceTray we are using for radcube updates is: https://github.com/icecube/icetray/tree/Update_radcube

1- Maketraces.py --> To create a data set used for training.

2- CombineRunData --> Combine the run data produced from the Maketraces script. Make sure to change the directories. It will store compressed files.
